POWERSHELL 


What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is an automation platform and scripting language for Windows and Windows Server that allows you to simplify the management of your systems. Unlike other text-based shells, PowerShell harnesses the power of the .NET Framework, providing rich objects and a massive set of built-in functionality for taking control of your Windows environments. 
PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)

PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a platform for testing and ensuring the declarative state of a system. DSC allows you to scale complex deployments across environments, enables collaboration of management, and corrects for configuration drift. 


PowerShell ISE

The PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a Windows application that supports enhanced usage of PowerShell for beginners and experts alike. The ISE's many features include:

    A built-in editor for writing, testing, and debugging scripts 
    Full IntelliSense tab completion, syntax highlighting, and context-sensitive help
    A myriad of keyboard shortcuts
    Support for right-to-left languages
    Extensible add-ons (like these from our community)
